Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

*Is there a difference between purchasing an app and an in-app payment?*

Not to the Marketplace. By the time the payment flow has reached the Marketplace, they are the
same. the Marketplace's job is just to process the payment.

An app and an in-app payment are handled differently in that they orginate from
different places and are fulfilled differently to the user. However all the
work for doing that can be found in Webpay.
